#  Rock, Paper, Scissors

A simple command-line **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in Python.  
The player competes against the computer, and after each round, the result is displayed.  
The game continues until the player chooses to quit.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The user chooses rock, paper, or scissors.

2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.

3. The winner is determined by the classic game rules:

    * Rock beats Scissors

    * Scissors beats Paper

    * Paper beats Rock

4. The game displays the result and asks if the user wants to play again.
